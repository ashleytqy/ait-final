# ðŸŒ¸ wallflower ðŸŒ¼

## Overview

Wallflower is a web app that will allow users to view and post poems based on a given prompt. Users can register and login. Once they're logged in, they can create a poem or view what others have written.


## Data Model

I'll be storing `Prompts`, `Users` and `Poems`.

* each `Prompt` can have multiple `Poems` (via references)
* each `User` can have multiple `Poems` (via references)

an example `Prompt`:
```javascript
{
    title: 'write a poem with 3 rhymes',
    poems: //an array of references to Poem documents
}
```

an example `User`:

```javascript
{
    name: 'jane doe',
    userID:  //generated UUID
    poems: //an array of references to Poem documents
}
```

an example `Poem`:
```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  prompt: //a reference to a Prompt object
  body: "this is a poem.",
  likes: 4
}
```

2. as a `User`, I can view all of the poems that respond to a given prompt
3. as a `User`, I can move the poems on a prompt page to display it the way I like
4. as a `User`, I can like a poem (tentative)
